Special note for developers: The source code was developed using Delphi 7 and Plugins. The QuantumGrid v3.22 is required but no longer available. This means that a manual conversion of tables from Tdx to Tcx has to be performed. Please follow the advise here from the plugin developers: https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/Details/DQ13868/convert-from-tdxdbgrid-v3-to-the-new-v5
